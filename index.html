            <h3>👋 A Bit About My Journey</h3>
            
            <p>I'm a second-year Computer Science student at VIT Bhopal, currently navigating the exciting chaos of learning cloud computing, real-time systems, and modern web development. Originally from Jaipur, I've spent countless late nights debugging code, exploring AWS services, and building projects that solve real problems.</p>
            
            <h3>🚀 What Drives Me</h3>
            <p>I want to work at the intersection of cloud infrastructure and real-time applications - building systems that scale effortlessly and connect people across the globe. PartyFlix started as a simple idea to watch movies with friends during lockdown, and Friendly Pocket was born from seeing tourists struggle with UPI payments in India. These experiences taught me that the best solutions come from understanding real user pain points.</p>
            
            <h3>💼 My Path So Far</h3>
            <p>From setting up AV systems for MUN events at St. Xavier's to deploying AWS infrastructure during my Worniwell internship, I've learned that technology shines brightest when it solves human problems. Late-night competitive programming sessions sharpened my problem-solving, while cloud certifications opened my eyes to scalable systems thinking.</p>
            
            <h3>🌟 Where I'm Headed</h3>
            <p>I'm seeking cloud engineering or full-stack development internships where I can contribute to production systems while learning from experienced engineers. I thrive in collaborative environments and love turning complex technical challenges into simple, elegant solutions. My goal is to build career-defining projects that make technology more accessible.</p>
